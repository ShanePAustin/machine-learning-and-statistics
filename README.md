### Problem statement
The following assignment required the creation of two Jupyter Notebooks one called ```scikit-learn.ipynb``` and the other ```scipy-stats.ipynb```.

#### scikit-learn 
The project required a clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library. Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms.

The notebook covers:
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Means Clustering

The main dataset used is Fisher's Iris data set

The notebook can be viewed here:

#### scipy-stats

The project required a clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library. An example hypothesis test using ANOVA.

This project carried out a one-way ANOVA on the diet dataset found here:

### How to Run:

To run the code locally this repository can be cloned and run using a python IDE or through Jupyter Notebook. The applications used for creation of the project are The Jupyter Notebook and Cmder.

* Download or clone current repository "machine-learning-and-statistics"
* Install Python - This was developed using Anaconda but the modules required to run are detailed in the ```requirements.txt```
* Refer to the ```requirements.txt``` and import as required
* Install Jupyter
* Run in Jupyter notebook
* Open and Run ```scikit-learn.ipynb``` or ```scipy-stats.ipynb```
* Once in the notebook, on the menu bar select Kernel and then click on the "Restart and run all" option.
* When you have finished, close or exit the tab in your browser.
* Enter "Ctrl + C" in the command prompt to end the jupyter lab session.
