### Problem statement
The following assignment required the creation of two Jupyter Notebooks one called ```scikit-learn.ipynb``` and the other ```scipy-stats.ipynb```.

#### scikit-learn 
The project required a clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library. Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms.

The notebook covers:
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Means Clustering

The notebook can be viewed here:

#### scipy-stats

The project required a clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library. An example hypothesis test using ANOVA.

This project carried out a one-way ANOVA on the diet dataset found here:
